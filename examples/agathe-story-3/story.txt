It's a bright sunny day in the Land of Snow and Ice. The little girl named Agathe is sitting on her bed in front of the mirror, brushing her long hair. She has been elected by her subjects to be the next Queen of the realm. It is time for her to ascend the throne.

Agathe takes a deep breath. "I can do this!" She says and puts down the brush. The little girl stands up and walks towards the door of her room, but before she opens it she takes one last look at herself in the mirror. She feels beautiful today! "I am ready." Agathe smiles at herself, grabs the golden key that hangs on a chain around her neck, and heads for the door.

The little girl opens the door to leave the room but she hears a loud noise coming from the other side of it. She looks behind the door and sees a giant snow monster standing there. The monster is holding a big snow shovel in one hand and a snowball in another. He has a big smile on his face, and he is clearly excited to see Agathe.

"Hello, little girl!" He says with a cheerful voice. "I heard you were going to be the next Queen of our kingdom, so I brought a gift for you! It's this snowball right here." The monster throws the snowball at Agathe. She doesn't have time to react before it hits her square in the face and covers her completely white hair with a thick layer of snow.
